**1. Global Styles (styles.css)**

Since you're using Tailwind CSS, you might not have a traditional `styles.css` file. However, if you have any global styles that you want to apply or any overrides to Tailwind's default styles, you can create one.

If you have custom CSS, create a file named `styles.css` in your `public/css` directory:

```css
/* Custom global styles or Tailwind overrides */
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:wght@400;500;600;700&display=swap');

body {
  font-family: 'Inter', sans-serif;
}

.custom-heading {
  font-size: 2.5rem;
  font-weight: 600;
  color: #1e3a8a; /* Tailwind's blue-900 */
  margin-bottom: 1.5rem; /* Tailwind's mb-6 */
}

.button {
  @apply font-semibold py-3 px-6 rounded-md transition duration-300;
}

.button-primary {
  @apply bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-600 text-white;
}

.button-secondary {
  @apply bg-gray-200 hover:bg-gray-300 text-gray-700;
}

/* You can add more global styles here */
```

**Explanation:**

* `@import url(...)`:  This line imports the Inter font, which you are using
* `body`:  This sets the global font family.  You already have this in the `<style>` tag in your HTML, but it's good practice to keep it in a CSS file.
* `.custom-heading`:  This is an example of a custom global style for headings.  It uses Tailwind's  `@apply`  directive to apply multiple Tailwind classes at once.  This is useful for creating reusable styles.
* `.button` and `.button-primary`, `.button-secondary`:  These are examples of reusable button styles, also using Tailwind's  `@apply`.

**2. Page-Specific Styles**

You shouldn't need separate CSS files for each page since you're using Tailwind.  Tailwind encourages you to apply styles directly in your HTML files using CSS classes.

**Where to Add Styles**

* **HTML Files:** The best place to add styles for your pages is directly within the HTML files (your Blade templates) using Tailwind CSS classes.  This keeps your styles close to the content and makes it easier to manage.  For example:

    ```html
    <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-6 text-center bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-200 to-blue-300 bg-clip-text text-transparent">
        About Our Platform
    </h2>
    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg">
        Welcome to EduHome...
    </p>
    <button class="bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded focus:outline-none focus:shadow-outline" type="submit">
        Register
    </button>
    ```

**Key Points**

* **Tailwind CSS:** You're using Tailwind CSS, which is a utility-first CSS framework.  This means you'll apply styles by adding classes directly to your HTML elements (e.g.,  `class="text-center text-blue-500 font-bold"`).
* **CSS File:** You typically won't need to create a lot of CSS.  For global styles  which you have already added in the HTML is sufficient..
* **Blade Templates:** In your Laravel Blade templates (e.g.,  `index.blade.php`), you'll apply Tailwind classes to your HTML elements.

Do you have any specific styling you want to implement that isn't covered by Tailwind, or would you like me to provide examples of how to style specific elements using Tailwind within your Blade templates?
